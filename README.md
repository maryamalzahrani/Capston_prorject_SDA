# Blockchain in KYC Verification:  


**Area of Project**:  
We need to go through a KYC verification in banks for updating our data and verifying our identity. Blockchain permits the secure transfer of KYC verification stamps from one entity to another. It offers a highly immutable and detailed audit trail on all actions on KYC files.

**Solution using Blockchain**:  
In our project, we will use a blockchain in KYC verification.
Blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger shared with everyone involved in the network. Every participant interacts with the blockchain using a public-private cryptographic key combination. Moreover, immutable record storage is provided, which is very hard to tamper. Banks can utilize the feature set of Blockchain to reduce the difficulties faced by the traditional KYC process. A distributed ledger can be set up between all the banks, where one bank can upload the KYC of a customer and other banks can vote on the legitimacy of the customer details. KYC for the customers will be immutably stored on the blockchain and will be accessible to all the banks in the Blockchain.

**Use Case**:  
This case study is divided into 3 parts to achieve the solution:
Project Structure:

- Phase 1:
Whenever a new customer enters the ecosystem, a bank initiates a KYC request for the customer.
Once checked for veracity, the bank uploads the customer's data onto the blockchain using the smart contract.
The KYC data can be accessed by other banks in real-time as and when required.
Other Banks can vote on the KYC process done by a bank for a customer to state that they acknowledge the process and accept the customer details.


- Phase 2:
Admin functionalities are provided for the system, where an admin can track the actions such as upload or approval of KYC documents performed by banks.
Other Banks can vote on the KYC process done by a bank for a customer. If the rating/votes are above the standard range then it is taken as an accepted KYC and used by other banks too.
Admin can block any bank from doing a KYC, admin can also add new banks or remove untrusted banks from the smart contract.


- Phase 3:
In this phase, the smart contract will be deployed over a private network that is put up between various banks.

**Goals:**
## Goals: 
- Main goals:

1- applied what we have learned during fintech Bootcamp.

2- When applying KYC by using blockchain can be achieved:

a- Data Quality: all data alterations are tracked and monitored in real-time.0

b- Lowered turnaround time: through KYC Blockchain software solutions, FIs get direct access to the data which saves data gathering & processing time

c- Reduced manual labor: KYC on Blockchain eliminates paperwork from the process. 

The benefits of KYC Blockchain implementation cannot be limited to these points. There are a number of sector benefits that the process of KYC using Blockchain offers.

- Streatch goals:

1- The truffle project directory.
